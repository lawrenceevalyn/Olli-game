# Olli-game
shh, this game is a surprise!

## To Do

* figure out how the game will be played
* write tests for map
* get basic map running
* write tests for inventory
* implement inventory system
* make it possible to talk to the robot
* improve the parser (can I kidnap somebody else's code for this?)

## Programming Log

### May 1 2017

Maybe use https://trinket.io/ for Olli to play the game in, so I don't have to muck about with web servers? Since the web server stuff won't be as relevant for my future work?

But I really like how the web interface lets the description stay visible without repeating. I could also try to do that by only printing the description when the player **enters** the room?
